We can turn this on to verify that the DOM can properly access JS functions.

The code here comes from a [pen](https://codepen.io/eduardoboucas/pen/BNyKwO) by Eduardo Boucas. Although code in *vendor.scss* is usually not modified, we have made changes here to better suit our purposes for this exercise.

#### c004
Because we cannot wrap the *icon* that toggles the mobile menu with ` .y-wrap `, we use a percentage that is half of the difference between 100% and the width of ` .y-wrap `.

#### c005
Whenever we use ` position: fixed `, we create more work for ourselves. This is the case for our navigation because we are combining three separate nav elements, all of which use ` position: fixed `. If we did not need a fixed navigation area, we could greatly simplify things by placing the nav elements inside of a wrapper control where they land on the page with less code. The nav elements are separate so we can provide a better user experience regardless of the device size â€“ in other words, we need a way to control how we show and hide a mobile menu. This also means that we need to use ` z-index `, which adds to the complexity of coding the UI. Aside from these issues, ` position: fixed ` creates more work for us when building a responsive site because if we ever change ` font-size `, for example, in an fixed area, we will most likely have to adjust the positioning of this area. The moral of the story is this: ` position: fixed ` should be avoided as much as possible. There are times when we have to use it but it should be a last resort since it adds extra work and complexity to our code.

It may not be immediately obvious but this class also includes the style definitions that create what the user perceives to be the entire navigation area.

*Sizer* is for development only and should be turned off before launch.

#### c008
This pseudo elements adds a white-to-transparent gradient which allows the text to fade out just before passing beneath the navigation.

#### c009
An ID is prefixed with ` t- ` to indicate that it is the *target* of a function in JavaScript. The name that follows the prefix is name of the class that is assigned to the same element. For example, ` id="t-navitems" class="navitems" `. IDs should never be styled.

#### c010
Any website with readable text will need a point defined at which its contents no longer continue to fill the width of the viewport.
